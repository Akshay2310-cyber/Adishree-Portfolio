          </LinkPreview>, I have been actively exploring the real-world impact of AI across applications—from building Flutter-based mobile solutions to developing intelligent systems during my internships. I have worked as a Machine Learning Intern at EY, where I contributed to building Agentic AI frameworks for Natural Language to SQL workflows, and I am currently an AI Application Developer Intern at ATmega Software Technologies LLP.

        <div className="mt-4">
          Previously, I interned at Shaale as a Flutter Developer, where I built mobile features using Dart and Flutter.
My technical interests span AI Agents, RAG Pipelines, LangChain, Machine Learning, NLP, Data Engineering, and Generative AI. I enjoy creating data-driven solutions that are practical, scalable, and intelligent.

          Alongside academics and projects, I have also taken part in hackathons, university tech events, and collaborative problem-solving with teams. I am currently seeking a 6-month internship in Data Science, ML, AI, or Data Engineering where I can apply my skills and continue learning in real-world environments.
